client -> istio ingress gateway -> envoy filter -> oauth proxy -> dex -> ldap

* Istio ingress gateway is an ingress gateway to the mesh that can have a public ip
* envoy filter intercepts http traffic to the sidecar proxy and checks whether the request is authenticated or not. If not it will send them to oauth proxy
* oauth proxy is a convenient proxy to perform oauth flows
* Dex is an existing identity provider inside k8s that integrates with LDAP as the identity source


After successful auth on the provider's page, you're supposed to be redirected back to this redirect url, 
with a url param "code=..." and your browser should also have a CSRF cookie (default "_oauth2_proxy_csrf"). 
If you hit that redirect url with those two elements, it should finally give you a "_oauth2_proxy" 
cookie and redirect you to the original destination (or else "/").
